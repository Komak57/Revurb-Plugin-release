# The Revurb Plugin

# Supports:
- Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity (jp): NPJH50332

This plugin contains a copy for either PPSSPP or Original Hardware.<br/>
PPSSPP requires the currently private-testing version of the emulator, NOT the public version (for now)<br/>
It supports the target GameID's. Other plugins or game versions may have problems if the memory addresses move.<br/>
This plugin supports various translation packs and mods. *Use with caution<br/>
Revurb allows the use of the original DLC if it exists on the system before you try to connect. I currently do not have a way to tell what language you are using.<br/>
PSP2:US and PSP2:EU share a server, but will be provided the original JP DLC, as it hasn't been translated yet.<br/>


> Problems have been noted on the original PSP2i game when connecting to a Universe, and seems to be a conflict when using a save file created on the translated version.<br/>
<br/>The game may intermittently fail to launch. This is a timing issue with the plugin on slower storage (or overburdened storage). Trying again will usually work.
